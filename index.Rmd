### M.S. CCC-SLP

When I was younger, my mom used to scoff at me if I got stuck on the word puzzles in the newspaper. I've gotten better at crosswords and cryptoquips, but I don't think I'll ever match her in word scrambles. Or at wheel of fortune, for that matter. 

Since then, I've become interested in a number of wordy things: writing, grammar, linguistics, speech-language pathology, phonetics, and children's speech. In the same way, this page is also interested in a number of wordy things, whether it be as "official" as my current research projects or as "unofficial" as a word puzzle I happen to come across. 

I welcome all word lovers here and invite you to message me about anything interesting going on in the world of words.
